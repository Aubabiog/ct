           The History of <span>Tulips </span>           </h1>

          <p class="description">
            Over a thousand years ago, Tulips grew wild in Persia, , <br>and near Kabul the Great Mogul Baber 
			counted thirty-three different species. The word tulip is, <br> thought to be a corruption of the Turkish word for turbans. <br>
			Persian poets sang its praises,  <br>and their artists drew and painted it so often, <br>
			that all of Europe considered the tulip to be the symbol of the Ottoman Empire.
<br><br>
There are people in the world who eat some varieties tulip bulbs, and Japan makes a flour from them. <br>
The Dutch have eaten tulip bulbs when no other food was available.

Wealthy people began to purchase tulip bulbs that were brought back from Turkey by Venetian merchants.<br>
 In 1610, fashionable French ladies wore corsages of tulips, and many fabrics<br>						
 were decorated with tulip designs. In the seventeenth century, a small bed of tulips was valued at 15,000-20,000 francs. <br>
 The bulbs became a currency, and their value was quoted like stocks and shares.
